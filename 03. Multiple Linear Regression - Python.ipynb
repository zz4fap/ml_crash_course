However, this would be expensive and time consuming.\n\n__Alternatively, we can use multiple linear regression__. Multiple linear regression can give us the relationship between each _feature_ and customer happiness. These are provided as _coefficients_ (slopes). Positive numbers indicate a positive relationship (i.e. customer happiness increases as this feature increases), negative numbers indicate a negative relationship (customer happiness decreases as this feature increases). Unlike _simple_ linear regression, these relationships should be independent. That means that our relationship between cocoa content and customer happiness should not be influenced strongly by bar weight or cost. \n\n### Below, replace: \n#### 1. `<addCocoaPercentHere>` with `cocoa_percent` \n#### 2. `<addCostPercentHere>` with `cost`\n### then __run the code__."

It looks like so:\n\n`customer_happiness = -9.34 + weight * 0.106 + cocoa_percent * 31.9 + cost * -1.31`\n\nWe might also know that, for our company, the cost of manufacturing and shipping each bar can be calculated as:\n\n`cost = (0.05 * weight + weight * cocoa_percent)^2 * 0.0004`\n\nFrom this, we can calculate the best bar for our customers, by balancing the cost against how happy the customer is likely to be with this product.\n\nLets plots this in 3D to see what our optimum chocolate bar should be.\n\nBelow, complete the calculation for customer happiness.\n\n#### Replace `<addThirdCoefHere>` and `<addFourthCoefHere>` as described in the comments and then __run the code__."
