# ML Crash Course Python Programming Exercises

Welcome! In this library we have the Python programming exercises for the ML Crash Course.

This Azure Notebook contains the programming exercises used in the ML Crash Course on [Microsoft AI School](https://aischool.microsoft.com). While you could explore the examples without following the tutorial, it's strongly recommended that you follow along with the course on AI School. To get started visit the link below:

## Troubleshooting

Below are some common issues and their solutions when completing the exercises in this Azure Notebook.

### Links to the exercises don't work

#### Solution

* Click [here](https://notebooks.azure.com/home/libraries) to go to your libraries
* Right clicking on your library and select __Settings__
* Change the Library ID back to Python.
